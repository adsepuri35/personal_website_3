Super Simple
Dark grey/black background + semi-white text
Sections:
 - Name (left-justified). Icons: Linkedin, Github, Email (right, justified)
 - Intro: just text. Include email, interests, hobbies stuff like that.
 - Experience: Contains blocks with icon left justified, Company/Org + Position, Years active
 - Projects: Larger blocks w/ link to Github. 2 blocks on each row. Short description included.

Notes:
 - Center everything but blocks only take up ~60% of screen
 - Blocks are glossy transparent with white borders (maybe implement push-rotate functionality)
 - When the width of screen is reduced, the main block shouldnt stay at 60% of the screen, it should stay at the initial 60%
